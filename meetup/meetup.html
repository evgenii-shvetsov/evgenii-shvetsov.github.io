                    <p>&nbsp&nbspThe Hack Reactor is a coding bootcamp. This company provides immersive programs helping people become software engineers and find a job in the tech industry. The Hack Reactor has a big tech community on the MeetUp website; almost 6000 members  are following <a class="external_link" href="https://www.meetup.com/hackreactor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hack Reactor: Learn to Code</a> group and take part in different workshops and tutorials.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbspThis group provides a lot of helpful Webinars mostly connected with web development. On April 17, 2021 I took part in one of the four-part Introductory JavaScript Series (101,201, 301, 401). It was a 3 hours Zoom meeting divided into 3 parts: Looping, Arrays, and Objects. Each section was about an hour; 40 minutes we were listening to the host; basically it was a plain theory,  and then we had about 20 minutes to solve programming tasks applying learned material. It was great that we were given GitHub links to all the material with tasks and solutions, so those of us who wanted to spend more time with the programming problems had a chance to work with all files after the webinar. It was a great opportunity to get some helpful information and see so many people improving their programming skills.</p>
